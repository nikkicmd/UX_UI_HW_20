This is a travel application, which allows users to schedule their trips conveniently and efficiently, by providing useful information or suggesting itineraries at destinations. Helps the user manage time, attractions, budget and expense during the journey

        <p>I interviewed 5 potential users over the 
          zoom to understand the challenges they face when 
          travelling. <br> <br>
          Some of the questions I asked: <br>
          1. How does a user plan their itinerary on a vacation? <br>
          2. What platforms are they using to book their travel flights and accommodations? <br>
          3. What are the pain points a user comes across when booking their vacation? <br>
          4. What types of users will use this app? <br>
          5. What influences a user on where to travel <br>
          6. Are users feeling safe about travelling post pandemic <br>
          7. Do users enjoy using a travel agency or a online book service <br>

        <p>Amy is a young professional, with a desire to travel and 
          elevate her photography portfolio. This summer she is planning 
          on taking a 3 week European vacation with her boyfriend. She 
          has a lot of places she would like to see so it’s important 
          for her to stay organized so that she doesn’t feel overwhelmed 
          while on vacation. During the research process I discovered 
          that many users felt overwhelmed with having to organize all 
          their travel dates, hotel stays, activities and ticket purchases. 
          It was hard to have everything organized in one place and easily 
          accessible on day of travel. I believe that people could benefit 
          from having an app that will help manage all their trip details 
          in one place so you’ll no longer need to sort through tons of 
          emails to find that email reservation, or you’ll be able to 
          determine which days you forgot to book a hotel.
